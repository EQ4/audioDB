INSTALLATION
============

The basic procedure is:

make
make test
make install

audioDB Dependencies
--------------------

bash: audioDB's test suite depends on /bin/sh being bash, version 3.0
      or greater.

libaudioDB: the dynamic library (available from
      <http://github.com/TransformingMusicology/libaudioDB>)

Compiling
---------

Use the following make commands to compile libaudioDB on your system:

Linux:         make

OS X or Win32: make \
  LIBAUDIODB="-L/path/to/libaudioDB/libraries -laudioDB"

Testing
-------

audioDB comes with a suite of test scripts that verify that particular
pieces of functionality are behaving acceptably.  They depend on
/bin/sh being GNU bash, version 3 or greater.  The test suite can be
run with the command "make test".

When running on systems without sparse file support (notably those
using the default filesystem in Mac OS X), running the test suite
requires approximately 70GB of free hard disk space.  On other
systems, disk usage from running the test suite is negligible.

Installation
------------

By default, the executable will be installed under the prefix
/usr/local. Edit the Makefile PREFIX value to select a different
installation location.

To install, issue the command:

make install

You will need sufficient privileges to write to your chosen
installation location and to execute the ldconfig command.
