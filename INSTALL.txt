Dependencies
------------

gsoap: audioDB uses libgsoap++ for SOAP Web Services support.  This
       can be installed on most linux distributions using the package
       manager; the binary distribution will suffice.  Other systems
       will need to install the library.

gengetopt: audioDB uses gengetopt (as of 2007-10-23, version 2.18
           exactly) for command-line parsing.

help2man: a spartan manual page is automatically generated from the
          usage text using help2man.

Use the following Makefiles to compile audioDB on your system:

Linux:         make
(Debian-derived systems, with the right versions of gengetopt, gsoap
and help2man installed)

OS X or Win32: make \
  GENGETOPT=/path/to/bin/gengetopt \
  SOAPCPP2=/path/to/bin/soapcpp2 \
  GSOAP_CPP=/path/to/gsoap/stdsoap2.cpp \
  GSOAP_INCLUDE="-I /path/to/gsoap"
(where the path in GSOAP_INCLUDE should name the directory in which
stdsoap.h resides)
