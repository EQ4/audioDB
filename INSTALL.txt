Dependencies
------------

gsoap: audioDB uses libgsoap++ for SOAP Web Services support.  This
       can be installed on most linux distributions using the package
       manager; the binary distribution will suffice.  Other systems
       will need to install the library.

gengetopt: audioDB uses gengetopt (as of 2007-10-23, version 2.18
           exactly) for command-line parsing.

help2man: a spartan manual page is automatically generated from the
          usage text using help2man.

Use the following Makefiles to compile audioDB on your system:

Linux:    Makefile
Mac OS X: Makefile.osx
Win32:    Makefile.win32
